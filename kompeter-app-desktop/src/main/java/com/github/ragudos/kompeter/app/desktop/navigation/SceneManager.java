     * This will split the scene name by {@link ParsedSceneName#SEPARATOR} and first
     * checks if the parent scene is already being displayed by the parent
     * {@link SceneManager}.
     *
     * <p>
     * If the parent scene is already being displayed, then it checks if scene name
     * contains a child scene name. The following steps will then be performed:
     *
     * <ul>
     * <li>If the child scene name is null, then it logs a warning and returns.
     * <li>If the child scene name is not null, then it checks if the parent scene
     * is a {@link SubSceneSupport}
     * <li>If the parent scene is a {@link SubSceneSupport}, then it checks if the
     * child scene is already being displayed by the parent scene's
     * {@link SceneManager}.
     * <li>If the child scene is already being displayed, then it logs a warning and
     * returns.
     * <li>If the child scene is not already being displayed, then it delegates the
     * navigation to the parent scene's {@link SceneManager}.

     * If the parent scene is not already being displayed, then it first navigates
     * to the parent scene. The following steps will then be performed:
     *
     * <ul>
     * <li>Get the {@link SceneEntry} of the parent scene from the
     * {@link SceneManager}.
     * <li>If the {@link SceneEntry} is null, then it logs a warning and returns.
     * <li>If the {@link SceneEntry} is not null, then it checks if the scene can be
     * accessed by a boolean returned by the {@link SceneGuard}.
     * <li>If the scene cannot be accessed, then it logs a warning and returns.
     * <li>Gets the currently displayed {@link Scene} and checks if it can be hidden
     * by calling the {@link Scene#canHide()} method.
     * <li>If the scene cannot be hidden, then it calls the current scene's
     * {@link Scene#onCannotHide()} method and returns.
     * <li>Loads or creates the scene. The following steps are performed:
     * <ul>
     * <li>Get the {@link Scene} from cache using the parent scene name.
     * <li>If the {@link Scene} is not null, then it returns it.
     * <li>Otherwise, the following steps are performed:
     * <ul>
     * <li>Gets the {@link SceneFactory} of the parent scene from the
     * {@link SceneEntry}.
     * <li>If the name of the created {@link Scene} is not equal to the name we're
     * trying to navigate to, then it logs a severe message while still continuing
     * the operation.
     * <li>Wraps the {@link Scene} in a {@link SceneWrapper}
     * <li>Calls the {@link Scene#onCreate()} method.
     * <li>Retrieves the view from the {@link Scene} and adds it to the root
     * container and {@link CardLayout} manager.
     * <li>If the {@link Scene} is a {@link SubSceneSupport}, then it calls the
     * {@link SubSceneSupport#navigateToDefault()} method.
     * <li>Updates the cache with the {@link Scene} using the parent scene name.
     * </ul>
     * </ul>
     * <li>If the scene cannot be shown, then it calls the
     * {@link Scene#onCannotShow()} method and returns.
     * <li>Finally, it switches the old scene with the new scene and calling their
     * respective hook lifecycle methods.
     * <li>Lastly, if the parent scene is a {@link SubSceneSupport}, it tries to
     * navigate to the child scene and repeats the same process as above.
     * </ul>
